  // {title : "Director's Speech", text: "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it. Proverbs 22.6

  // As a household word that is strategically balanced within our Nation’s educational system, Goshen City and Goshen Stars Global College is a brand name that has sprung to limelight within a couple of years ago, and indeed a dream come through. As a brand name that implies to sparkle, shine, glitter, or appear bright, the idea of naming the academy Goshen City and Stars by the founder of the academy was not accidental.
  // The initiative to set up this Academy was I believe, as a result of the explosive rapid changes within the social structures of the society in which we live. In other words, the birth of this Academy was an Earnest effort by the Executive Director/ CEO to nurture a group of future leaders who would not only intellectually, but socially and morally steer the affairs of this Nation to its destined destination.
  // Having the conviction in mind that Nigeria can be better, her initiative was not purely capitalistic in thought but rather, an effort to better strengthen the mechanics of our social structure by using the educational enterprise, being the backbone to which advancement can be attained to achieve her objectives.
  // There is no gainsaying the fact that parents have always done their best towards instilling discipline in their children. But, we should also not forget that some obvious reasons have hampered most parents from offering a full-fledged moral training to their children.
  // Critically looked at, most parents nowadays have lesser time to rub Minds with their kids. That, coupled with the discernible importance of education has compelled many parents to rest their trust in us as a group. Our priceless morals as a nation are eroding as a result of the multifarious imported cultures that we tend to accommodate. That has in turn crippled and at the same time, pauperized our precious cultural and moral heritage. More so, other changes within the social structure have contributed to hampering the smooth sailing of our better identity.
  // Based on the aforesaid however, we must walk ecstatically towards the attainment of more credible objectives. These students are like our children. We must continue to see that they are given the necessary care and discipline that are being required. Our goal is beyond architecting students with intellectual prowess but without the religious, moral, spiritual, and social preconditions that the society requires as the basics for the life that is worth living.
  // Notwithstanding, our collective indulgence is very much necessary in ensuring that the purpose for which this Academy was established is not defeated. As tutors, our roles lye beyond that of teaching curriculum based ideologies and issuing scholastic certificates. We are duty-bound to mould and develop a crop of intellectuals that have the necessary prerequisite for moving our dear Country to the next level. This is for the simple reason that Talent alone has never been all that is required for a more meaningful and purposeful life.
  // Considering the fact that the Hand That Rocks the Cradle is the hand that rocks the world, we must take the lead by ensuring that we instill in these children the thoughts of being the best that they can. We must inject into their mind the sense of responsibility in whatever they do. They have to understand that the routes to attaining greatness require becoming responsible citizens.
  // By implication, there is a fundamental need to enhance our methods and procedures so as to meet up with the very much expectation that our Society has rested on us. Proving the name Goshen City and Goshen Stars requires a duo of extraordinary academic gauge and a compelling social, religious and moral standard. In other words, as long as transforming our Country to Greater Heights is what we crave for, an encapsulation of the aforesaid is the best methodology to use in attaining a better positive outcome.
  // As Goshen City and Goshen stars  glistens, may its glistening continue to glow.

  // OKAKA, IFEOMA CHINWE
  // Director & Founder"}
